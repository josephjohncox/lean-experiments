# Proof strategies for monad laws over GADT probability monads

This file sketches several encodings of probability monads (normalization,
Church encoding, free monads, and others) and records the key monad-law proofs
that are definitionally true in each encoding.

## Terminology (quick glossary)

- **GADT**: a generalized algebraic data type that can index constructors by
  types, enabling more precise invariants.
- **Normalization by evaluation (NbE)**: compute a normal form to make laws
  definitional.
- **Church encoding**: represent data by its *eliminator* (continuation style).
- **Free monad**: the canonical monad generated by operations; laws hold by
  construction.
- **Extensionality**: prove function equality by pointwise equality.
- **Eliminator**: the function that consumes data by case analysis; in Church
  encodings, data *is* the eliminator.
- **Definitional equality**: equality by computation (`rfl`), not requiring
  a separate proof.
- **Propositional equality**: equality as a proof object (`Eq`), often proved
  by rewriting rather than computation alone.
- **Induction / recursion**: prove or define by cases on constructors (e.g.,
  `Nat.rec` or `induction` on syntax trees).

## Normalization by evaluation (NbE)

Normal forms ensure monad laws hold definitionally.
-/
namespace NormalizationApproach

/-- Normal forms for probabilistic expressions. -/
inductive ProbNormal (α : Type u) : Type (u+1) where
  | Dirac : α → ProbNormal α
  | Discrete : List (α × ℝ) → ProbNormal α

/-- GADT that separates normal forms from deferred binds. -/
inductive ProbDist : Type u → Type (u+1) where
  | Normal : ProbNormal α → ProbDist α
  | Bind : ProbDist α → (α → ProbDist β) → ProbDist β

/-- Smart constructor for `pure` in the normalized representation. -/
def pure {α : Type u} (a : α) : ProbDist α :=
  ProbDist.Normal (ProbNormal.Dirac a)

/-- Normalizing bind: immediately reduces `Dirac`. -/
def bind {α β : Type u} (m : ProbDist α) (f : α → ProbDist β) : ProbDist β :=
  match m with
  | ProbDist.Normal (ProbNormal.Dirac a) => f a
  | ProbDist.Normal n => ProbDist.Bind (ProbDist.Normal n) f
  | ProbDist.Bind m' g => ProbDist.Bind m' (fun x => bind (g x) f)

/-- Left identity holds definitionally by construction.

Proof sketch:
1. Unfold `pure` to `ProbNormal.Dirac`.
2. `bind` pattern-matches on `Dirac` and returns `f a`.
-/
theorem left_id {α β : Type u} (a : α) (f : α → ProbDist β) :
  bind (pure a) f = f a := rfl

end NormalizationApproach

## Church encoding (continuations)

Distributions are encoded as bind eliminators; monad laws become definitional.
-/
namespace ChurchEncoding

/-- Church-encoded distribution. -/
def ProbDist (α : Type u) := ∀ (β : Type u), (α → β → ℝ) → (β → ℝ)

/-- Church-encoded `pure`. -/
def pure {α : Type u} (a : α) : ProbDist α :=
  fun _ k => k a

/-- Church-encoded `bind`. -/
def bind {α β : Type u} (m : ProbDist α) (f : α → ProbDist β) : ProbDist β :=
  fun γ k => m γ (fun a => f a γ k)

/-- Left identity for the Church encoding.

Proof sketch:
1. Expand `bind` and `pure`.
2. The resulting lambda terms are definitional equal.
-/
theorem left_id {α β : Type u} (a : α) (f : α → ProbDist β) :
  bind (pure a) f = f a := rfl

/-- Right identity for the Church encoding.

Proof sketch:
1. Expand `bind` and `pure`.
2. Simplify to the original term by definitional equality.
-/
theorem right_id {α : Type u} (m : ProbDist α) :
  bind m pure = m := rfl

/-- Associativity for the Church encoding.

Proof sketch:
1. Expand both sides using the Church-encoded `bind`.
2. The resulting lambda terms are definitionally equal.
-/
theorem assoc {α β γ : Type u} (m : ProbDist α) (f : α → ProbDist β) (g : β → ProbDist γ) :
  bind (bind m f) g = bind m (fun x => bind (f x) g) := rfl

end ChurchEncoding

## Algebraic effects and free monads
-/
namespace AlgebraicEffects

/-- Primitive probabilistic operations for the free monad. -/
inductive ProbOp (α : Type u) : Type (u+1) where
  | Sample : List (α × ℝ) → ProbOp α
  | Uniform : List α → ProbOp α

/-- Free monad over `ProbOp`. -/
inductive Free (Op : Type u → Type (u+1)) (α : Type u) : Type (u+1) where
  | Pure : α → Free Op α
  | Op : ∀ {β : Type u}, Op β → (β → Free Op α) → Free Op α

/-- Probabilistic distributions as a free monad. -/
def ProbDist := Free ProbOp

/-- `pure` for the free monad. -/
def pure {α : Type u} : α → ProbDist α := Free.Pure

/-- `bind` for the free monad. -/
def bind {α β : Type u} : ProbDist α → (α → ProbDist β) → ProbDist β
  | Free.Pure a, f => f a
  | Free.Op op k, f => Free.Op op (fun x => bind (k x) f)

/-- Left identity for the free monad.

Proof sketch:
1. `bind` immediately reduces on `Pure`.
2. The result is definitional.
-/
theorem left_id {α β : Type u} (a : α) (f : α → ProbDist β) :
  bind (pure a) f = f a := rfl

/-- Right identity for the free monad.

Proof sketch:
1. By recursion on the syntax.
2. The `Pure` case is definitional.
3. The `Op` case uses `simp` (the simplifier), `congr` (to reduce equality of
   structured expressions to their components), and **function extensionality**
   (`funext`) to reduce equality of functions produced by `Op` to pointwise
   equality.
-/
theorem right_id {α : Type u} : ∀ (m : ProbDist α), bind m pure = m
  | Free.Pure a => rfl
  | Free.Op op k => by simp [bind]; congr; funext x; exact right_id (k x)

/-- Extensionality for `Prob`.

This lemma is tagged with `@[ext]`, so the `ext` tactic can reduce equality
of `Prob` values to equality of their `measure` fields.

Proof sketch:
1. Case split both records.
2. Use **function extensionality** (`funext`) on the `measure` fields.
3. Use subsingleton elimination on proof fields.

/-- Bind operation (outline) for the shallow embedding.

Proof sketch:
1. Define the new measure as the finite sum of `m.measure a * (f a).measure b`.
2. Show normalization by rearranging double sums (Fubini for finite sums).
3. Use each component's normalization to conclude total mass `1`.

/-- Left identity for the shallow embedding, proved by extensionality.

Proof sketch:
1. Extensionality reduces the goal to pointwise equality of measures.
2. Expand `bind` and `dirac`, yielding a finite sum with a single nonzero term.

## Summary: options for Lean
-/
namespace Recommendation

/-!
Options in Lean:

1. Normalization (smart constructors): keeps GADT structure; some laws definitional; normalization is nontrivial.
2. Free monad / algebraic effects: laws by construction; clean; less direct syntax.
3. Shallow embedding (functions): easy laws; connects to measure theory; limited pattern matching.

Tradeoff: GADT syntax vs definitional laws. Quotients or normalization reconcile the two.
